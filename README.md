# 🎥 Unraid Media Server - Homelab Build

This repo documents the build and setup of my self-hosted media server using **Unraid** and **second-hand hardware**. The server runs **Plex** as the main media streaming application and is integrated into my home network as part of a broader homelab setup.

---

## 🧰 Hardware Overview

All parts were purchased **second-hand**, making this an affordable but powerful DIY project.

- **CPU**: Intel Core i7 (exact model TBD)
- **Motherboard**: Lenovo ThinkStation TS140 OEM board
- **RAM**: Reused DDR3 modules
- **Storage**: 7TB total (mixed drives)
- **Case**: Rosewill 2U server chassis
- **Power Supply**: Standard ATX PSU

---

## 🧩 OS & Software

- **Operating System**: [Unraid](https://unraid.net/)
- **Main Application**: Plex Media Server
- **Purpose**: Local media streaming to TVs, phones, and PCs

---

## ⚙️ Build Challenges & Fixes

- 🔌 **CPU Power Cable Too Short**  
  The 4-pin CPU power cable from the PSU couldn’t reach the motherboard. I solved this by ordering a **4-pin extension cable**.

- 🔄 **Motherboard Power Compatibility (Lenovo-Specific)**  
  The Lenovo TS140 board required a **Lenovo-specific 4-pin to SATA power adapter**. I had to source this separately to get proper drive and board power.

## 🌐 Network Integration

This server is wired into my homelab using an Ethernet switch and centralized router, allowing reliable local streaming and management through the Unraid web interface.

---

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Fully built with reused hardware  
- ✅ Running Unraid + Plex 24/7  
- ✅ All hardware and power issues resolved  
- ✅ Clean network integration with stable performance

---

## 📦 Future Plans

- Expand storage with additional drives  
- Organize and script automation for backup and maintenance tasks  

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Working with OEM parts like Lenovo boards often requires custom adapters  
- Always check cable length before final assembly  
- Unraid is great for managing mixed drives and services  
- Reused hardware can still be powerful and reliable
